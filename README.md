- ★★★Material-UI/core
- Material-UI/icons
- react-query
- Came a hard problem, how to type axios, or fetch, or async& await, promise, it's hard to me
- read more function
- useContext/ useReducer
- localStorage
- Add item with certain color selected, the type of item in the cart is different from the product type
- imitate and implement Sephora's color selection function (seems the tricky logic for me)
- useMemo to store the initial value of CartItem, the only changed value is product color
